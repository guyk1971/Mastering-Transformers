Alternatively, we can use regular expressions, where we can define advanced patterns such as the lexico-syntactic pattern. These traditional approaches cannot handle synonym (for example, car is the same as automobile) or word sense problems (for example, bank as the side of a river or bank as a financial institute). While the first synonym case causes low recall due to missing out the documents that shouldn't be missed, the second causes low precision due to catching the documents not to be caught. Vector-based or semantic search approaches can overcome these drawbacks by building a dense numerical representation of both queries and documents.\n","\n","## Case Study: Transform idle FAQ to Question Answering Model\n","\n","Let's set up a case study for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) that are idle on websites. We will exploit FAQ resources within a semantic search problem. FAQs contain frequently asked questions. We will be using the FAQ from the World Wide Fund for Nature ([WWF](https://www.wwf.org.uk/)), a nature non-governmental organization .\n","\n","Given these descriptions, it is easy to understand that performing a semantic search using semantic models is very similar to a one-shot learning problem, where we just have a single shot of the class (a single sample), and we want to reorder the rest of the data (sentences) according to it. You can redefine the problem as searching for samples that are semantically close to the given sample, or a binary classification according to the sample. Your model can provide a similarity metric, and the results for all the other samples will be reordered using this metric. The final ordered list is the search result, which is reordered according to semantic representation and the similarity metric."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"fzDG7HERuriy","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2913,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625404253107,"user":{"displayName":"Savas Yıldırım","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhdhYZMfq-hvK2xI7HqkzvJuCbfgFrIs4wypQEm5w=s64","userId":"10717726124681851716"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"fzDG7HERuriy","outputId":"178d67b5-00cd-46c2-a0c9-480f7177927e"},"outputs":[],"source":["# !pip install sentence-transformers"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"GmqJ32A9PMP7","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1011,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625404258696,"user":{"displayName":"Savas Yıldırım","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhdhYZMfq-hvK2xI7HqkzvJuCbfgFrIs4wypQEm5w=s64","userId":"10717726124681851716"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"GmqJ32A9PMP7"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import sklearn\n","import numpy as np"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"XhHPVbz5PMhr","metadata":{"id":"XhHPVbz5PMhr"},"source":["https://www.wwf.org.uk/\n","\n","World Wide Fund for Nature\n","Non-governmental organization"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"3-EfV5fQQh3k","metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":275,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625404261183,"user":{"displayName":"Savas Yıldırım","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhdhYZMfq-hvK2xI7HqkzvJuCbfgFrIs4wypQEm5w=s64","userId":"10717726124681851716"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"3-EfV5fQQh3k"},"outputs":[],"source":["wwf_faq=[\"I haven’t received my adoption pack.
